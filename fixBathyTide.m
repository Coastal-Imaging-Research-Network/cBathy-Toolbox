%    fix the tide levels in a bathy. I.e., find the current 
% predicted or measured tide and subtract it from the h.
% This routine now accepts CIL compatible and non-compatible inputs.  If
% bathy.sName (the stack name) can be parsed successfully using
% parseFilename, use the tide function with two arguments, the station and
% the epoch.  This ensures that we can't mistakenly find tides from the
% wrong station (because the station name comes from the stack name).  If
% parseFilename fails, the user is responsible for ensuring they have
% supplied a correct tide function in params.tideFunction and only the
% epoch time is passed as an input.
%

%% Find estimated depths and tide correct, if tide data are available.
  
if (exist(bathy.params.tideFunction) ~= 2)   % existing function
