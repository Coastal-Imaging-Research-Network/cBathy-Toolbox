%  compute a lookup interpolation map between columns of a stack and an
%  intended array described by pixelArray = [xmin dx xmax ymin dy ymax]
%  that could be the intended array of pixel locations or perhaps the array
%  of cBathy analysis points or whatever.
%
%  this function used knnsearch to return the N nearest neighbors and the
%  weights for each mapping distance.
%
%  If 'map' is empty or omitted, a new map will be created. Otherwise, the main 
%  result of this function will be the x,y output locations.
%
%  if N is omitted, it will be set to 1.
%  
%  doNan is a flag that specifies that any points further than doNan units
%  away from the nearest neighbor will return -1 in map, which will be
%  converted to NaN in the output of useInterpMap. Zero means don't do
%  that. If you use doNan, you must provide N.
