%   smoothBathy = KalmanFilterBathyNotCIL(priorBathy, newBathy, H);
%
%  carries out a Kalman filter smoothing of a new Bathy collect adding
%  to a priorBathy using simple Kalman filtering.  Standard bathy
%  structures are assumed and passed along, updating the file name of
%  the prior.  Filtered data are stored in the sub-structure
%  runningAverage.  This version assumes that we are not in a CIL
%  environment.

Q = findProcessError(newBathy.params.stationStr, newBathy, H)*dt;
P = nansum(cat(3, priorBathy.runningAverage.P, Q),3);

% update everywhere then fix the nan problems in prior or new
K = P ./ (P + newBathy.fCombined.hErr.^2);
hSmoothed = hPrior + K.*(hNew-hPrior);
PNew = (1-K).*P;

% deal with nan's
badNew = find(isnan(hNew) | isnan(hNewErr)); % stick with hPrior

PNew(badNew) = P(badNew);   % pass along growing covariance

badPrior = find(isnan(hPrior));     % take new if no prior
hSmoothed(badPrior) = hNew(badPrior);
PNew(badPrior) = hNewErr(badPrior).^2;   % pass along covariance guess

% cap any runaway variances at a max value to avoid K=0 when P is huge
% Holman 01/22/12 fix for runaways.
