%
%  altered version of nlparci specifically modified to handle the bathy
%  estimation problem for cBathy and to account for the weighted
%  contribution to the sum of squares.  The only change is to reduce the
%  number of degrees of freedom depending on the weights, w.
%
%  Inputs:
%   resid   - Nx1 vector or prediction residuals from k-estimates
%   J       - if flag = 1,Jacobian (both these are from nlinfit)
%           - if flag = 0, expected input is J'*J, from LMFnlsq.m
%   w       - weights used in weighted nlinfit
%   flag    - 1 = use statistics toolbox, 0 = don't use stats toolbox
%  Output:
%   bathyErr - 95% confidence interval on depth estimate.
%
%  Scalped from nlparci for special case of single parameter (bathy)
%  estimation.  Holman, 2012.
